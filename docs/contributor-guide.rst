üêõ Bug Reports / üôã Feature Requests
------------------------------------

Please leave bug reports and feature requests as `Github issues <https://github.com/Datatamer/unify-client-python/issues/new/choose>`_ .

----

Be sure to check through existing issues (open and closed) to confirm that the
bug hasn‚Äôt been reported before.

Duplicate bug reports are a huge drain on the time of other contributors, and
should be avoided as much as possible.

‚Ü™Ô∏è Pull Requests
----------------

For larger, new features:

  `Open an RFC issue <https://github.com/Datatamer/unify-client-python/issues/new/choose>`_ .
  Discuss the feature with project maintainers to be sure that your change fits with the project
  vision and that you won't be wasting effort going in the wrong direction.

  Once you get the green light üö¶ from maintainers, you can proceed with the PR.

Contributions / PRs should follow the
`Forking Workflow <https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/forking-workflow>`_ :

  2. Create your feature branch::

  4. Push to the branch::
