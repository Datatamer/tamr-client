# How to write docs

When writing user-facing documentation, pick one of the four options:
1. Tutorial
2. How-To guide
3. Explanation
4. Reference

For more, see descriptions below or [Divio's documentation system manual](https://documentation.divio.com/).

### Tutorial

Tutorials are learning-oriented and ...
- must walk-through a self-contained domain like "Deduplicating buildings in Cambridge".
- must provide any necessary configuration and data for the tutorial.

### How-To guide

How-To guides are problem-oriented and ...
- must answer a specific, domain-agnostic question like "How to stream datasets out of Tamr"

### Explanation

Explanations are understanding-oriented and ...
- must explain core concepts of Tamr or the Tamr client
- may include code examples

### Reference

Reference is information-oriented.

Our reference documentation is automatically generated by [autodoc](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/autodoc.html) based on type annotations and docstrings in the source code.
